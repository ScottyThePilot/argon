# Argon

This is my very first Minecraft mod, which aims to make some minor changes to fill some gaps in the game's progression and balance.

## Features

Two ores, Nitre (Saltpeter) ore and Brimstone (Sulfur) ore.
Nitre can be found in the overworld, spawns at the same levels and in the same ammounts as Coal ore, but is more rare.
Brimstone can be found in the nether, spawns at the same levels as Quartz, but is more rare.

Both ores drop their respective materials and can be crafted together with Charcoal to create three gunpowder.

A new Potion type, Anti-Poison which prevents the Poison effect from being applied to you, and is brewed with Nitre.

A new item, Tanned Flesh, which can be smelted from Rotten Flesh and can be crafted in a 2x2 square into regular Leather.
